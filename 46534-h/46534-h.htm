OUR READERS SAY
</p>


<p>
"The second number looks to me even more interesting than the first.
Smith's tale was splendid. The remunerative editors were certainly
fools to turn it down. Glad to see that a number of readers are
showing up Ackerman. People like Ackerman are peculiarly
ridiculous&#8212;one can plainly see that this type of thing is merely
egotistic and a gesture to call attention to themselves. However, most
people out-grow this stage. Glad you were able to get something from
young Barlow&#8212;he's distinctly worth encouraging." H. P. Lovecraft
</p>

<p>
Clark Ashton Smith informs us that Astounding Stories has just
accepted one of his tales, "The Demon of the Flowers," and Weird Tales
has just taken "The Tomb Spawn." He tells us that we will find a
surprise in connection with his story, "The Weaver in the Vault" in
the January, 1934, Weird Tales.
</p>

<p>
"Your editorial was a corker, the various departments okay, and
Smith's yarn was worthy of Weird Tales." Allen Glasser. Mr. Glasser is
attempting to make a living at writing&#8212;and isn't doing so bad at it.
The editor prefers to call him "the Arthur J. Burks of the younger
generation." He has sold stories to dozens of magazines, including
science fiction.
</p>

<p>
"The second issue was swell. I'd like to see more stories by Clark
Ashton Smith in future issues of the mag. Yep, 20 pages of excellent
articles and stories."&#8212;Ted Lutwin. Clark Ashton Smith is a regular
contributor to THE FANTASY FAN.
</p>

<p>
Kenneth B. Pritchard, although he liked the second number immensely,
reminds us that we omitted several things that we promised in the
September issue. Here's the reason: many articles were crowded out of
this number, and others were postponed to make room for a number of
much better articles which came in the last minute. Everything
promised will be published in good time, though.
</p>

<p>
Lloyd Fowler wants us to keep using the grade of paper that we are,
instead of cutting down the number of pages in order to afford a
better grade.
</p>

<p>
"THE FANTASY FAN is starting out well."&#8212;Ralph Milne Farley
</p>

<p>
From A. Merritt, whom everybody knows, we hear that he had started a
sequel to "Thru The Dragon Glass," but abandoned it because he didn't
like to write sequels. Our belief is that great authors don't need to
write sequels.

SUPERNATURAL HORROR IN LITERATURE
</p>

<p class="ctrsmall">

</p>

<p class="ctr">
Part Two
</p>


<p>
Because we remember pain and the menace of death more vividly than
pleasure, and because our feelings toward the beneficent aspects of
the unknown have from the first been captured and formalised by
conventional religious rituals, it has fallen to the lot of the darker
and more maleficent side of cosmic mystery to figure chiefly in our
popular supernatural folklore. The tendency, too, is naturally
enhanced by the fact that uncertainty and danger are closely allied;
thus making any kind of an unknown world, a world of peril and evil
possibilities. When to this sense of fear and evil the inevitable
fascination of wonder and curiosity is superadded, there is born a
composite body of keen emotion and imaginative provocation whose
vitality must of necessity endure as long as the human race itself.
Children will always be afraid of the dark, and men with minds
sensitive to hereditary impulse will always tremble at the thought of
the hidden and fathomless worlds or strange life which may pulsate in
the gulfs beyond the stars, or press hideously upon our own globe in
unholy dimensions which only the dead and the moonstruck can glimpse.
</p>

<p>
With this foundation, no one need wonder at the existence of a
literature of cosmic fear. It has always existed, and always will
exist; and no better evidence of its tenacious vigour can be cited
than the impulse which now and then drives writers of totally opposite
leanings to try their hands at it in isolated tales, as if to
discharge from their minds certain phantasmal shapes which would
otherwise haunt them. Thus did Dickens write several eerie narratives;
Browning the hideous poem, "Childe Roland"; Henry James, "The Turn of
the Screw"; Dr. Holmes, the subtle novel "Elsie Venner"; F. Marion
Crawford, "The Upper Berth" and a number of other examples; Mrs.
Charlotte Perkins Gilman, social worker, "The Yellow Wall Paper";
whilst the humorist, W. W. Jacobs, produced that able melodramatic bit
called "The Monkey's Paw."

<p class="ctr">
Part Three&#8212;Conclusion
</p>


<p>
Science Wonder Stories (now Wonder Stories) published a 2-part serial
by Edwards in 1930, "A Rescue from Jupiter," and its sequel, "The
Return from Jupiter," appeared the following year.
</p>

<p>
Many characters have been so liked that their author creators have
written a number of sequel-stories around them in which they are
plunged into a series of exciting adventures. The most popular are
Keller's Taine of San Francisco, Meek's Dr. Bird, Quinn's Jules de
Grandin, Gilmore's Hawk Carse, Burroughs' Tarzan &#38; John Carter,
Wright's Commander Hanson, and Fezandie's Dr. Hackensaw.
</p>

<p>
Of course, it is realized that only the surface of this subject has
been skimmed, but if the reader is further interested in sequels, he
may idle away many an interesting hour considering why stories have
sequels, and what stories should have them.

<p class="ctrtoppad">
The Other Gods
</p>

<p class="ctrsmall">
by H. P. Lovecraft
</p>


<p>
Atop the tallest of earth's peaks dwell the gods of earth, and suffer
no man to tell that he hath looked upon them. Lesser peaks they once
inhabited; but ever the men from the plains would scale the slopes of
rock and snow, driving the gods to higher and higher mountains till
now only the last remains. When they left their older peaks they took
with them all signs of themselves, save once, it is said, when they
left a carven image on the face of the mountain which they called
Ngranek.
</p>

<p>
But now they have betaken themselves to unknown Kadath in the cold
waste where no man treads, and are grown stern, having no higher peak
whereto to flee at the coming of men. They are grown stern, and where
once they suffered men to displace them, they now forbid men to come;
or coming, to depart. It is well for men that they know not of Kadath
in the cold waste, else they would seek injudiciously to scale it.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes when earth's gods are homesick they visit in the still night
the peaks where once they dwelt, and weep softly as they try to play
in the olden way on remembered slopes. Men have felt the tears of the
gods on white-capped Thurai, though they have thought it rain; and
have heard the sighs of the gods in the plaintive dawn-winds of
Lerion. In cloud-ships the gods are wont to travel, and wise cotters
have legends that keep them from certain high peaks at night when it
is cloudy, for the gods are not lenient as of old.
</p>

<p>
In Ulthar, which lies beyond the river Skai, once dwelt an old man
avid to behold the gods of earth; a man deeply learned in the seven
cryptical books of earth; and familiar with the Pnakotic Manuscripts
of distant and frozen Lomar. His name was Barzai the Wise, and the
villagers tell of how he went up a mountain on the night of the
strange eclipse.
</p>

<p>
Barzai knew so much of the gods that he could tell of their comings
and goings, and guessed so many of their secrets that he was deemed
half a god himself. It was he who wisely advised the burgesses of
Ulthar when they passed their remarkable law against the slaying of
cats, and who first told the young priest Atal where it is that black
cats go at midnight on St. John's Eve. Barzai was learned in the lore
of earth's gods, and had gained a desire to look upon their faces. He
believed that his great secret knowledge of gods could shield him from
their wrath, so resolved to go up to the summit of high and rocky
Hatheg-Kla on a night when he knew the gods would be there.
</p>

<p>
Hatheg-Kla is far in the stony desert beyond Hatheg, for which it is
named, and rises like a rock statue in a silent temple. Around its
peak the mists play always mournfully, for mists are the memories of
the gods, and the gods loved Hatheg-Kla when they dwelt upon it in the
old days. Often the gods of earth visit Hatheg-Kla in their ships of
cloud, casting pale vapours over the slopes as they dance
reminiscently on the summit under a clear moon. The villagers of
Hatheg say it is ill to climb Hatheg-Kla at any time, and deadly to
climb it by night when pale vapours hide the summit and the moon; but
Barzai heeded them not when he came from neighboring Ulthar with the
young priest Atal, who was his disciple. Atal was only the son of an
innkeeper, and was sometimes afraid; but Barzai's father had been a
landgrave who dwelt in an ancient castle, so he had no common
superstition in his blood, and only laughed at the fearful cotters.
</p>

<p>
Barzai and Atal went out of Hatheg into the stony desert despite the
prayers of peasants, and talked of earth's gods by their campfires at
night. Many days they travelled, and from afar saw lofty Hatheg-Kla
with his aureole of mournful mist. On the thirteenth day they reached
the mountain's lonely base, and Atal spoke of his fears. But Barzai
was old and learned and had no fears, so led the way boldly up the
slope that no man had scaled since the time of Sansu, who is written
of with fright in the mouldy Pnakotic Manuscripts.
</p>

<p>
The way was rocky, and made perilous by chasms, cliffs, and falling
stones. Later it grew cold and snowy; and Barzai and Atal often
slipped and fell as they hewed and plodded upward with staves and
axes. Finally the air grew thin, and the sky changed colour, and the
climbers found it hard to breathe; but still they toiled up and up,
marvelling at the strangeness of the scene and thrilling at the
thought of what would happen on the summit when the moon was out and
the pale vapours spread around. For three days they climbed higher,
and higher toward the roof of the world; then they camped to wait for
the clouding of the moon.
</p>

<p>
For four nights no clouds came, and the moon shone down cold through
the thin mournful mists around the silent pinnacle. Then on the fifth
night, which was the night of the full moon, Barzai saw some dense
clouds far to the north, and stayed up with Atal to watch them draw
near. Thick and majestic they sailed, slowly and deliberately onward;
ranging themselves round the peak high above the watchers, and hiding
the moon and the summit from view. For a long hour the watchers gazed,
whilst the vapours swirled and the screen of clouds grew thicker and
more restless. Barzai was wise in the lore of earth's gods, and
listened hard for certain sounds, but Atal felt the chill of the
vapours and the awe of the night, and feared much. And when Barzai
began to climb higher and beckon eagerly, it was long before Atal
would follow.
</p>

<p>
So thick were the vapours that the way was hard, and though Atal
followed on at last, he could scarce see the grey shape of Barzai on
the dim slope above in the clouded moonlight. Barzai forged very far
ahead, and seemed despite his age to climb more easily than Atal;
fearing not the steepness that began to grow too great for any save a
strong and dauntless man, nor pausing at wide black chasms that Atal
could scarce leap. And so they went up wildly over rocks and gulfs,
slipping and stumbling, and sometimes awed at the vastness and
horrible silence of bleak ice pinnacles and mute granite steeps.
</p>

<p>
Very suddenly Barzai went out of Atal's sight, scaling a hideous cliff
that seemed to bulge outward and block the path for any climber not
inspired of earth's gods. Atal was far below, and planning what he
should do when he reached the place, when curiously he noticed that
the light had grown strong, as if the cloudless peak and moonlit
meeting-place of the gods were very near. And as he scrambled on
toward the bulging cliff and litten sky he felt fears more shocking
than any he had known before. Then through the high mists he heard the
voice of unseen Barzai shouting wildly in delight:
</p>

<p>
"I have heard the gods! I have heard earth's gods singing in revelry
on Hatheg-Kla! The voices of earth's gods are known to Barzai the
Prophet! The mists are thin and the moon is bright, and I shall see
the gods dancing wildly on Hatheg-Kla that they loved in youth. The
wisdom of Barzai hath made him greater than earth's gods, and against
his will their spells and barriers are as naught; Barzai will behold
the gods, the proud gods, the secret gods, the gods of earth who spurn
the sight of man!"
</p>

<p>
Atal could not hear the voices Barzai heard, but he was now close to
the bulging cliff and scanning it for footholds. Then he heard
Barzai's voice grow shriller and louder:
</p>

<p>
"The mist is very thin, and the moon casts shadows on the slope; the
voice of earth's gods art high and wild, and they fear the coming of
Barzai the Wise, who is greater than they&#8230;. The moon's light
flickers, as earth's gods dance against it; I shall see the dancing
forms of the gods that leap and howl in the moonlight&#8230;. The light is
dimmer and the gods are afraid&#8230;."
</p>

<p>
Whilst Barzai was shouting these things Atal felt a spectral change in
all the air, as if the laws of earth were bowing to greater laws; for
though the way was steeper than ever, the upward path was now grown
fearsomely easy, and the bulging cliff proved scarce an obstacle when
he reached it and slid perilously up its convex face. The light of the
moon had strangely failed, and as Atal plunged upward through the
mists he heard Barzai the Wise shrieking in the shadows:
</p>

<p>
"The moon is dark, and the gods dance in the night; there is terror in
the sky, for upon the moon hath sunk an eclipse foretold in no books
of men or of earth's gods&#8230;. There is unknown magic on Hatheg-Kla, for
the screams of the frightened gods have turned to laughter, and the
slopes of ice shoot up endlessly into the black heavens whither I am
plunging&#8230;. Hei! Hei! At last! In the dim light I behold the gods of
earth!"
</p>

<p>
And now Atal, slipping dizzily up over inconceivable steeps, heard in
the dark a loathsome laughing, mixed with such a cry as no man else
ever heard save in the Phlegethon of unrelatable nightmares; a cry
wherein reverberated the horror and anguish of a haunted lifetime
packed into one atrocious moment:
</p>

<p>
"The Other gods! The Other gods! The gods of the outer hells that
guard the feeble gods of earth&#8230;. Look away&#8230;. Go back&#8230;. Do not
see! Do not see! The vengeance of the infinite abysses&#8230;. That
cursed, that damnable pit&#8230;. Merciful gods of earth, I am falling
into the sky!"
</p>

<p>
And as Atal shut his eyes and stopped his eyes and stopped his ears
and tried to jump downward against the frightful pull from unknown
heights, there resounded on Hatheg-Kla that terrible peal of thunder
which awaked the good cotters of the plains and the honest burgesses
of Hatheg, Nir and Ulthar, and caused them to behold through the
clouds that strange eclipse of the moon that no book ever predicted.
And when the moon came out at last Atal was safe on the lower snows of
the mountain without sight of earth's gods, or of the Other gods.
</p>

<p>
Now it is told in the mouldy Pnakotic Manuscripts that Sansu found
naught but wordless ice and rock when he did climb Hatheg-Kla in the
youth of the world. Yet when the men of Ulthar and Nir and Hatheg
crushed their fears and scaled that haunted steep by day in search of
Barzai the Wise, they found graven in the naked stone of the summit a
curious and Cyclopean symbol fifty cubits wide, as if the rock had
been riven by some titanic chisel. And the symbol was like to one that
learned men have discerned in those frightful parts of the Pnakotic
Manuscripts which were too ancient to be read. This they found.
</p>

<p>
Barzai the Wise they never found, nor could the holy priest Atal ever
be persuaded to pray for his soul's repose. Moreover, to this day the
people of Ulthar and Nir and Hatheg fear eclipses, and pray by night
when pale vapours hide the mountain-top and the moon. And above the
mists on Hatheg-Kla, earth's gods sometimes dance reminiscently; for
they know they are safe, and love to come from unknown Kadath in ships
of cloud and play in the olden way, as they did when earth was new and
men not given to the climbing of inaccessible places.

INFORMATION

If you are puzzled by any fact connected with fantasy fiction, send

<p class="ctrtoppad">
STARTLING FACT
</p>


<p>
Many readers have asked the Editor where they could secure such books
as the "Necronomicon," "The Book of Eibon" and other books of medieval
sorcery mentioned in the stories of Clark Ashton Smith, H. P.
Lovecraft, and other authors of weird tales.
</p>

<p>
Upon these requests, the Editor wrote to Clark Ashton Smith, inquiring
of him whether these books had been translated into English as yet or
not, whereupon, Mr. Smith informs us as follows:
</p>

<p>
"'Necronomicon,' 'Book of Eibon,' etc., I am sorry to say, are all
fictitious. Lovecraft invented the first, I the second. Howard, I
believe, fathered the German work on the Nameless Cults. It is really
too bad that they don't exist as objective, bonafide compilations of
the elder and darker Lore! I have been trying to remedy this, in some
small measure, by cooking up a whole chapter of Eibon. It is still
unfinished, and I am now entitling it 'The Coming of the White
Worm'&#8230;. This worm mentioned in Eibon is Rlim Shaikorth, and comes
from beyond the pole on a strange, gigantic iceberg with a temperature
of absolute zero."
</p>

<p>
We'll bet that most Smith and Lovecraft fans really believed in the
existence of these books (as did the editor). A reader informs us that
in the July issue of Weird Tales, these books were mentioned in three
stories.
</p>

<p>
This incident only goes to prove that Smith and Lovecraft have the
gift of creating the "illusion of reality," the phrase defined in the
1924 Anniversary Number of Weird Tales.

ANNALS OF THE JINNS
</p>

<p class="ctrsmall">
by R. H. Barlow
</p>

<p class="ctr">
2&#8212;The Shadow From Above
</p>


<p>
A midsummer day in the hamlet of Droom. The villagers went about their
various tasks, and within the tiny market-square the spice-vendors and
the people from the hills with their exotic burdens of gay fruits
created a pleasant hum of busy occupation. Sleeping dogs lay
contentedly in the warm sunlight, and the squat beasts of burden
ambled about peacefully upon their six clawless paws, their grotesque
faces slit with toad-like grins. All was, no one could have denied,
entirely calm.
</p>

<p>
Then one of the dogs lying in a doorway sprang suddenly and omitted a
sharp bark. At the same moment a dark cloud apparently obscured the
sun. In a short time it had passed unnoticed save for the dog. But his
owner&#8212;an old crone in a voluminous black hood&#8212;peered intently at the
clear and vacant sky, and started chattering in an excited tone. Soon
the whole population was out of doors looking upwards at that which
could not be seen yet which cast a deep shadow. Nothing was to be
perceived in the expanse of blue, yet upon the square cobblestones of
the quaint little village an irregular black form wavered back and
forth. Then it grew larger. Whatever it may have been, it was
settling. The people drew back afrightened. Slowly the swinging motion
ceased, and the thing drew near. A deep, heavy panting was distinctly
audible, much like that of a great beast, and with a dull impact as
though it was of great weight, it alighted upon a grassy plot before
the Chancellor's house. For a long time it lay there, resting. And
still nothing could be seen save the indentation of the grass nor
aught heard but the heavy breathing.
</p>

<p>
Then, to the terror of the white-faced and nervous citizens, it rose
on giant feet and tramped down a lane. Thud&#8230;. Thud&#8230;. Thud&#8230;.
Thud&#8230;. The sound grew monotonous in its deliberation. Before its
path lay a sleeping hound. It was lifted as if in a vast claw, and
vanished among horrid rending sounds. A single drop of blood flecked
the earth&#8230;. Its taste momentarily sated, the thing paused and
turned.
</p>

<p>
It took some moments for reason to replace the stark terror of the
townsfolk. Then there was a mad and frantic rush for the nearest
houses. Those to first gain entrance barred the doors upon their
comrades. In a moment the street was apparently bare&#8212;save for the
unseen monster.
</p>

<p>
All that afternoon and night it pried at doors, scratched at roofs,
muzzled windows and upset fruits-carts inquiringly. But the people of
Droom had built well. It did not gain entrance during the night,
although few slept, when they heard the constant breathing before
their homes, and the dull thumping sounds as it wreaked its malice
upon the shops of the marketplace.
</p>

<p>
It was high noon before any dared unbar their doors and venture forth.
Nothing unusual greeted their blanched faces, and silently,
apprehensively they stole to their tasks. Soon all activity again
commenced.
</p>

<p>
The horror had gone.

<p class="ctrtoppad">
THE BOILING POINT
</p>


<p>
Herewith we continue the Ackerman-Smith debate, which is waxing hot.
</p>

<p>
"The Ackerman-Smith controversy assumes all the aspects of a mad
comedy. To assail and reprehend the writings of Clark Ashton Smith is
as preposterous and futile as a dwarf transporting a huge mountain
peak upon the tip of his tiny finger. Either Forrest J. Ackerman is
daft or an imbecile or a notoriety-seeking clown and knave. Clark
Ashton Smith stands alone in the realm of present-day weird and
fantastic literature, and, therefore, above all his contemporaries. He
is still King: and has yet to be dethrone."&#8212;Robert Nelson.
</p>

<p>
"Personally, I thought that 'The Light From Beyond' was very good, and
I saw nothing weird about it. It was fantasy and not stf., but some of
the greatest classics of so-called science fiction have been almost
pure fantasy. Witness: Merritt's 'Snake Mother' and 'Moon Pool,' and
Taine's 'Time Stream.' Ackerman's objections to this were particularly
obnoxious to me, as I thought it one of the best stories ever written.
Certainly, there should be something more to science fiction than
rays, machines, villains, heroines (composed of lipstick and leg, as
Mr. Barlow rather bitterly expresses it), as has been stressed so
greatly of late. There should be an element of fantasy, strong
characters, and a well-developed plot in addition. The lack of those
is why so many weird story lovers (like Mr. Barlow) can find so much
fault with stf. I do not blame him. I, myself, as a reader, will stop
reading stf when the fantasy element is dropped completely." William

<p>
Not so much in rebuttal to Mr. Ackerman as to toss another stick
onto the fire, let me confess that the scientific fiction type of
literature seems to me among the dullest written. I avoid whenever
possible, except in such cases where it passes the boundaries into
the weird and horrible. Of course, the work of Wells is an exception.
This may be blasphemy to most of your readers, but there it is. To
return to Mr. Ackerman's complaint: I fail to see why it is any more
deplorable for Wonder Stories to publish Clark Ashton Smith's
horror story than for Weird Tales to publish Edmond Hamilton's
pseudo-scientific effusions. And it was Amazing Stories that had the
honor to publish "The Colour Out of Space" by America's master of the
weird, Lovecraft. Richard E. Morse.

A DREAM OF THE ABYSS

<p class="flushleft">
<br>I seemed at the sheer end:
<br>Albeit mine eyes, in mystery and night
<br>Shrouded as with the thick profundity of death,
<br>Or as if underneath Lethean lentors drowned,
<br>Saw never lamp nor star nor dead star's wraith of light,
<br>Yet seemed I at the world's sheer end;
<br>And fearfully and slowly I drew breath
<br>From silent gulfs of all uncertainty and dread,
<br>Precipitate to Nadir from around;
<br>Nor trusted I on any side to tread
<br>One pace, lest I should overstep the brink
<br>And infinitely and forever sink
<br>Past eye-shot of the Cyclopean sun,
<br>When from the bulwark of the world adown oblivion,
<br>He on the morrow should stare after me.

<p class="flushleft">
<br>Swift from infinity,
<br>The black, unformed, enormous Fear that lives between the stars,
<br>Clutched with the cold, great darkness at my heart.
<br>Then from the gulf arose a whispering,
<br>And rustle as of Silence on the wing,
<br>To stay and stand
<br>Anear at my right hand:
<br>What Powers abysmal, born o' the blind black air,
<br>What nameless demons of the nether deep
<br>That 'scape the sun and from the moonlight live apart,
<br>Came and conspired against me there
<br>I heard not, ere the whispering
<br>Ceased, and a heavier darkness seemed to spring
<br>Upon me, and I felt the silence leap
<br>And clasp me closer, and the sweep
<br>Of all the abyss reach up and drag
<br>Body and feet from the crumbling uttermost crag
<br>To the plumb and infinite emptiness unknown:
<br>Nor knew I, in tumult of the rapid air,
<br>If me did Azrael or Abaddon bear,

Part Three
</p>


<p>
Volume one number one of Mind Magic, a magazine dealing with the
occult, was June, 1931. It lasted until the end of the year, December,
1931 issue. (The last two issues were published under the title of My
Self Magazine.) Another science fiction magazine, Miracle, Science and
Fantasy Stories, disappeared after issuing two numbers, the April-May
and June-July, 1931. The same publisher of this magazine, Harry
Hershey, printed some good fantasies in Ghost Stories. Exact dates of
this magazine are unknown to the writer, but the magazine gave up its
ghost sometime in 1932.
</p>

<p>
Hugo Gernsback, editor of Wonder Stories, put out two magazines that
expired within a year. The first, Air Wonder Stories (July, 1929 to
May, 1930) dealt with aviation of the future, mostly. It combined with
Science and Wonder Stories in June, 1930 to form the present Wonder
Stories. The other, Scientific Detective Monthly, appeared in January,
1930, and after changing its name to Amazing Detective Tales in June
collapsed with the October, 1930 issue.
</p>

<p>
Oriental Stories, companion magazine to Weird Tales, burst forth on
the stands September 15, 1930. Some excellent weird and oriental tales
made their appearance in this magazine, which afterwards, in January,
1933, became Magic Carpet. Black Cat magazine (published around 1924)
had some weird and scientifiction stories. These issues are
particularly hard to obtain.

CLUB NEWS
</p>


<p>
The Fantasy Fan Fraternity, announced in our September issue, is now
well under way, with members in nine different states. The purpose of
the organization is to foster fellowship among science-fiction fans by
means of correspondence, or where possible, by personal contact in
local groups or chapters.
</p>

<p>
The first such chapter has been established in New York City, where
the Scienceers, first fan club of its kind, is functioning as the
local Fraternity branch. Meetings are held every week; and membership
is open to all metropolitan fans. Further information about this group
may be obtained from the secretary, Allen Glasser, 1610 University
Avenue, Bronx, New York.
</p>

<p>
Any reader wishing to join the national F.F.F., or to found a branch
in his community, should send six cents in stamps to Mr. Glasser, at
the above address, for a membership card and a list of other members
with whom to correspond. This small charge, to cover necessary
expenses, is the only cost of enrollment into the Fraternity&#8212;a
nation-wide association devoted solely to the interests of fantasy
fans. Why not be one of us?

TRUE GHOST STORIES
</p>

<p class="ctr">
(Part Two&#8212;Conclusion)
</p>


<p>
At one time there was a woman of rank living in London who was hated
by everyone. When she died, she was not missed, but her spirit haunted
her home every night. After a number of years someone saw her approach
one side of a room and paw at a wall. Then she disappeared. The wall
was removed and many valuable papers were discovered, including one
that proved she had murdered her husband. Her ghost never appeared
after that. It seemed that at last she had repented her evil
existence, and was trying to redeem her soul.
</p>

<p>
The guard of the London prison tower was making one of his nightly
rounds when he discovered a peculiar light emanating from the utmost
tower. Upon climbing up he noticed that it was an unearthly blue-white
light which permeated everything within, but seemed to have no point
of origin. Within this baleful gleam he saw the spirits of those that
had died in the London tower through the ages&#8212;warriors of the time of
Henry the Eighth&#8212;and noblemen of all periods. They were marching in a
solemn procession. Suddenly everything faded and the guard found
himself in utter darkness.
</p>

<p>
There are many other ghost stories of London&#8212;such as phantom hands
appearing above the water of the Thames, sworn to by witnesses to be
gospel truth&#8212;but our reason forces us to reject them.
</p>

<p>
Recently, the noted Weird Tales author, Elliott O'Donnell, released
his book, "Ghosts of London," which relates further tales of this
nature.

<p class="ctr">
(Series Three)
</p>


<p>
An all-science-weird magazine started in England to last for just one
issue. The title was "Argo Weekly." The number contained various stf
stories concerning everything from prehistoric animals to the "End of
the World."
</p>

<p>
A late September number of "The Wizard" carried a fair story of
another Martian invasion entitled "Raiders from the Red World." The
invaders landed among the native tribes of Africa, instead of New York
City, the usual landing place. And, incidentally, they were not slugs,
giants, or etc., but just ordinary human beings.
</p>

<p>
"The Skipper" published a humorous story named "Ginger Snapp." In this
tale, an old professor invents a contrivance that emits a ray which
disintegrates metal by the push of a button. More rays! The
professor's son is surprised to see his dinner disappear while
monkeying with the mechanism.
</p>

<p>
As a rule, English magazines have covers that would make Buffalo Bill

go to extremes to amaze the reader.

Reposing in a futuristic box are ninety-six autographs. Cummings,
Flagg, Olsen, Repp, the three Smiths, Taine, Keller, Breuer, Hamilton,
Merritt, Coblentz, Burks, Williamson, Farley, Meek, Paul, Morey,
Wesso, Verrill, Leinster&#8212;and half a hundred more. Also, there is a
special collection of scientifilm actors' autographs. These are more
difficult to obtain, and some necessitate writing abroad, but to date
I have "The Frankenstein Monster," the heroine of "Tarzan," J-21 and
LN-18 of "Just Imagine," the director of "By Rocket to the Moon" and
"Metropolis," "Dracula," Roxor of "Chandu," and many others too
numerous to mention. Tho not a part of the collection, it may prove
interesting to readers that I have seen in person "Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde," "Dracula," "Dr. Moreau," and "Chandu" (Frederic March, Bela
Lugosi, Charles Laughton and Edmund Lowe).
</p>

<p>
I have autographed photographs from Leslie F. Stone, "Doc" Smith, Ed
Earl Repp, Capt. S. P. Meek, Miles J. Breuer, Victor Rousseau, Sewell
Peaslee, Charles Willard Diffin, Edmond Hamilton and others. Mr.
Wright presented me with a personal sketch of his "Retired Commander

<p>
Second in the series&#8230;. And speaking of the April 1933 Amazing,
"Martian and Troglodyte," by Neil R. Jones was printed on the cover,
but the story did not appear in the issue. The printing of the
editorial, which took two more pages than hitherto, and some of the
Discussions were increased in size&#8230;. The May 1933 Amazing was the
first one of 86 not to contain part of a serial. The August-September
had none either&#8230;. Have you ever wondered what letter of the alphabet
authors pick on most as the first one in the title of their stories
(omitting articles 'a,' 'the,' and 'an,')? Of course you haven't.
Well, I'll tell you, anyway. An average of one-tenth of all the
stories written begin with the letter "M," and another tenth with "S."
That is their rating in a collection of over 2000 stories&#8230;. So,
Amazing is trying to get rid of the word "scientifiction" that
Gernsback coined, eh?&#8230; By the looks of the contents page of the May
1933 Weird, you would think that every story was complete&#8230;. The May,
1926 Amazing contains two stories by Jules Verne&#8230;. And the March
1930 Science Wonder had two stories by Frank J. Brueckel&#8230;. And you
can find other similar cases, such as the Amazing Annual containing
two stories by A. Merritt, and the June, 1930 Astounding with two of
Diffin's yarns (one under the pseudonym of C. D. Willard).

<p class="ctrtoppad">
HOW TO WRITE A STF STORY
</p>

<p class="ctrsmall">
by Hoy Ping Pong
</p>


<p>
The first thing to remember in writing a science story is originality.
You must have that, so the first things to select for your brain-child
is a hero, heroine, and villain. No plot is needed. Or, if you desire
one, that can be thot up after the story is finished.
</p>

<p>
Have your hero a tall, slim, cold, grey-eyed chap, with an iron jaw,
and a sturdy body. He also must know all there is to know about
everything. Now for the heroine; she must be a small, slim blond,
blue-eyed, and be a scientist's daughter. That's the big point in
originality. Nobody has ever thought of her being a scientist's
daughter before. Now next comes the villain. He must be tall, dark,
with snapping black eyes, and a brush across his upper lip. He must
have an impossible name that no one can pronounce, including yourself.
I would suggest someone who desires to have world domination. That,
also, is original.
</p>

<p>
The big surprise of your story is this: Your villain must desire the
heroine for himself. That is something that is new to STF readers.
And, of course, I would politely suggest that the hero also want the
girl. That would make a triangle out of it. The hero must chase the
villain all over the universe, because the villain has the heroine in
his vile clutches. Don't forget the word vile. Nobody has ever used
that.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the invaders from Mars arrive on the scene about this time,
also desiring world conquest. It would be a nice point of originality
here to have the villain throw in with the Martians. It wouldn't do to
have the whole army overthrow the enemy. The hero must do it himself,
singlehanded.
</p>

<p>
And, a few death rays can be used in the story. Select a fitting
color, (some authors prefer pink). I would suggest lavender, which
would just match the heroine's pocketbook, and have it wipe out
millions by merely a few puffs. However, if you could do it all in a
puff and a half, that would merit you another point. Then you must
have the hero invent a ray that stops the lavender death rays. Yellow
would be best for this. It makes such an excellent color scheme.
</p>

<p>
Throw in a few space ships, a couple fights, a shot in the dark, four
or five corpses, a high official who turns traitor, a last flight for
help, and end it up with a lone man battling hundreds. Mix thoroughly,
and type out on paper, forgetting to double space your lines, as all
editors request that you doublespace, thereby showing them that you
are really original.
</p>

<p>
No plot is needed, as mentioned in paragraph one, but if you want one,
read one of Grimm's Fairy Tales, and borrow a plot. It makes no
difference what kind, as they are all fairy tales, anyway. As a final
bit of advice, fold the manuscript several times, and send it to the
editor with no enclosed postage for its return. By doing this the
editor will not have to go to the trouble of returning it to you, and,
so long as the Chief Waste Paper Basket Monitor doesn't get snoopy and
start reading the refuse, there will be no ill effects on
anyone&#8212;(providing the editor hadn't read it in the first place&#8212;and
in the case that he did&#8212;well, there's places for people like that.
New editors are cheap nowadays, anyway.)

FAMOUS FANTASY FANS
</p>

<p class="ctr">

</p>


<p>
Heart disease was CHR's means of becoming introduced to science
fiction. Confined to bed he was given a copy of Science and Invention
which he read and re-read many times, liking its science fiction
story, "The Man on the Meteor" by Ray Cummings, best of all. He never
lost one whit of his interest in fantasy fiction, and has become a
keen judge of what is best in this field.
</p>

<p>
Always retiring in nature, he first came to notice in a vigorous
campaign he conducted for increasing the membership of the
International Scientific Association, and for innovating a Science
Fiction Week. Hugo Gernsback was so pleased with this latter idea, and
with CHR's work in trying to put it over, that CHR was awarded a $50
prize in the "What I Have Done for Science Fiction" contest that
Science Wonder Quarterly conducted at that time.
</p>

<p>
His pet idea for many years was to issue a science fiction fan
magazine. The Depression decided him upon the desperate expedient of
launching the SCIENCE FICTION DIGEST without adequate preparation.
Unwilling to take any credit for the work he appointed Maurice Z.
Ingher as the Digest's editor, but when Mr. Ingher was forced to
resign because of other duties, he reluctantly took the editorship.
There is plenty of testimony to satisfy all as to the success he has
attained with his little magazine, the SCIENCE FICTION DIGEST.
</p>

<p>
As for his age, and other personal points, he is 21, unmarried, and
considers life quite thrilling. He is a printer by occupation, being
one of the partners of the ARRA Printers, who have given the fans
several science fiction pamphlets.
</p>

<p>
Though he declares he is not modest, he cannot be convinced that he
has done anything unusual. It is his courage and determination that
has carried the 'Science Fiction Digest' through the rough spots of
its career, and it is stern judgement that selects the articles and
stories which so please the readers of SFD, or FANTASY Magazine, as it
will be called.

The word "weird" as meaning bizarre probably originated with Edgar
Allan Poe, who was one of the greatest coiner of words. Is his poem
"Ulalume," he speaks of the country of "Weir" from which the word
"weird" was derived to describe anything horrible or unique.
